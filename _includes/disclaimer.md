## Disclaimer
This extension does not change OpenCart core files and has been tested to compatibility with the default OpenCart structure and theme. But third-party themes and extensions may cause incompatibilities, and they or the extension will need to be tweaked to fix it. The developer is not responsible for this and is not obliged to fix it, but can do so - for an additional fee, which is discussed separately.
